# Road Trip
# [Live Link: Road Trip](https://tourist-21214.web.app)

I have done this project using React-Router(private-route),Context-API,React-Bootstrap.
For user authentication, I used Firebase authentication system.

User can select a type of ride  and after that user will provide current location and destination.Regarding that
information, user will see trip cost.
